## Practice: output your name

Write a program that displays your name in the console

{% JDoodle %}
print("Hello, world! This is Python 3!")
{% endJDoodle %}

* The “Hello world!” program always outputs the same text
* To print a different text, we need to modify the argument of the print statement
  * Modifying the code means obtaining a different program
  * Fundamentally, both programs perform the same **action** only on different **data**
* More useful programs should solve a **generic problem** where the **problem instance** is specified at **runtime**

## Problem vs Problem instance

* Example of a computational **problem**: “Sorting in increasing order a set of integers”
* Example of an **instance** of the above problem: “Sorting in increasing order the set {9, 5, 2, 7, 3}”
* When a computational problem has multiple instances, the algorithm requires input
  * The **input** of the algorithm is the **problem instance**
  * The **output** of the algorithm is the **solution** of the problem instance

## Solving problems with algorithms

* **Algorithm** : sequence of **_steps_**, expressed in a certain **_language_**, followed by a **_processor_**, to solve a **_problem_**
  * _Processor_: not necessarily a computer; can be a human being
  * _Problem_: not necessarily computational; can be making a meal
  * _Language_: not necessarily a programming language; could be natural language
  * _Steps_: not necessarily machine instructions; could be physical actions
* With this definition, a cake recipe is an algorithm
* Some conditions to be verified:
  * Processor understands the language
  * Steps are within the capabilities of the processor
  * Problem is solvable by the processor (some problems are not solvable by computers like mathematical proofs)

## Algorithm vs Program

* An algorithm (of a computational problem) can be expressed in multiple ways:
  * Using natural language, e.g. English
  * Using a chart
  * Using pseudocode: mix of natural language and programming constructs
  * Using a specific programming language
* A program is one form of an algorithm
* Since an algorithm expects input and produces output, a programming language need to provide constructs to exchange this data  with its user.

## Standard Input and Output

* Users interacts with programs via an **interface**
  * **_Console_**: basic multi-line text display and typing
  * **_Graphic_**: one or more windows with text, graphics and more.
* Programming languages provide constructs to:
  * Acquire or get text from the Console: input
  * Display or print text to the Console: output
* The “Hello world” program illustrates basic **text** output via the `print` statement
* Obtaining **text** typed by the user on the console is achieved by the `input` function
* `print` and `input` are functions, part of the Python Standard Library
  * Other forms and means of I/O require other constructs from the Python Standard Library (like files, discussed later) or even different libraries (e.g. tkinter for GUI)

## Greetings

{% JDoodle %}
user = input("What is your name?")
print("Hello", user, ", nice to meet you.")
{% endJDoodle %}

* `input`: function which
  * prints the text argument AKA prompt
  * acquires (and returns) whatever text the user will type to the console
* `user`: **object** (AKA  **variable**)  that will receive and store the user input.
* Simplest program with
  * input and output
  * problem instance and solution
