## Warmup refresher: output your name

Write a program that displays your name in the console

{% JDoodle %}
print("Malek Smaoui")
{% endJDoodle %}

* The “Hello world!” program always outputs the same text
* To print a different text, we need to modify the argument of the print statement
  * Modifying the code means obtaining a different program
  * Fundamentally, both programs perform the same **action** only on different **data**
* More useful programs should solve a **generic problem** where the **problem instance** is specified at **runtime**

## Problem vs Problem instance

* Example of a computational **problem**: “Sorting in increasing order a set of integers”
* Example of an instance of the above problem: “Sorting in increasing order the set {9, 5, 2, 7, 3}”
* When a computational problem has multiple instances, the algorithm requires input
  * The **input** of the algorithm is the **problem instance**
  * The **output** of the algorithm is the **solution** of the problem instance

## Solving problems with algorithms

* **Algorithm** : sequence of _steps_, expressed in a certain _language_, followed by a _processor_, to solve a _problem_
  * _Processor_: not necessarily a computer; can be a human being
  * _Problem_: not necessarily computational; can be making a meal
  * _Language_: not necessarily a programming language; could be natural language
  * _Steps_: not necessarily machine instructions; could be physical actions
* With this definition, a cake recipe is an algorithm
* Some conditions to be verified:
  * Processor understands the language
  * Steps are within the capabilities of the processor
  * Problem is solvable by the processor

## Algorithm vs Program

* An algorithm (of a computational problem) can be expressed in multiple ways:
  * Using natural language, e.g. English
  * Using a chart
  * Using pseudocode: mix of natural language and programming constructs
  * Using a specific programming language
* A program is one form of an algorithm
* Since an algorithm expects input and produces output, a programming language need to provide constructs to exchange this data  with its user.

## Standard Input and Output

* Users interacts with programs via an interface
  * _Console_: basic multi-line text display and typing
  * _Graphic_: one or more windows with text, graphics and more.
* Programming languages provide constructs to:
  * Acquire or get text from the Console: input
  * Display or print text to the Console: output
* The “Hello world” program illustrates basic **text** output via the `print` statement
* Obtaining **text** typed by the user on the console is achieved by the `input` function
* `print` and `input` are functions, part of the Python Standard Library
  * Other forms and means of I/O require other constructs from the Python Standard Library (like files, discussed later) or even different libraries

## Greetings

{% JDoodle %}
user = input("What is your name?")
print("Hello", user, ", nice to meet you.")
{% endJDoodle %}

* `input`: function which
  * prints the text argument AKA prompt
  * acquires (and returns) whatever text the user will type to the console
* `user`: **object** (AKA  **variable**)  that will receive and store the user input.
* Simplest program with
  * input and output
  * problem instance and solution

## Objects or variables

* User input, program output and intermediary data used to solve a problem need to be stored in **memory** to be accessed and used as needed
* A program needs to designate a memory **container** to store a specific piece of data
* A program uses **aliases or names** to designate specific pieces of data
* The interpreter (and the Operating System) maps these aliases to actual addresses (locations) in the memory hardware, where the data is written (stored)
* An object (variable) is a programming abstraction used to represent (name) a memory location where some specific data is stored
* It has:
  * An identifier
  * A value
  * A type;  _inferred from the initial value assigned to it_
* E.g.: the statement `x = 10` initializes an object with **identifier** `x` to the **value** `10` , so its **type** will be _integer_

## Types

* The basic built-in types are:
  * `int`  for integer
  * `float`  for floating point  which is an approximation of real numbers
  * `str`  for string which is a sequence of characters (text)
  * `bool`  for Boolean
* Other compound / advanced data types will be discussed later

## Initializing and printing variables

* Create a string, an integer, a Boolean and a floating point number objects. 
  * The string should be named  `sampleString` and should contain the word `"hello"`. 
  * The floating point number should be named `sampleFloat` and should contain the number `10.5`
  * The Boolean should be named `sampleBoolean` and should contain the value `True`.
  * The integer should be named `sampleInt` and should contain the number `20`.
* Write the necessary output statements to obtain the following output. 

```
sampleString = hello
sampleInt = 20
sampleFloat = 10.5
sampleBoolean = True
```

Make sure that if you change the initial value of a variable, the displayed value changes automatically, without editing the corresponding output statement

{% JDoodle %}
sampleString = "Hello"
sampleInt = 25
sampleFloat = 10.5
sampleBool = False

print("sampleString =", sampleString)
print("sampleInt =", sampleInt)
print(sampleFloat)
print(sampleBool)
{% endJDoodle %}

* `print`  function can take variables as arguments and outputs the **value** of the variable
* `print`  function can take multiple comma-separated arguments:
  * Arguments can be literal text, variables, expressions, etc.
  * By default, consecutive arguments are separated by a single space (see customization later)
  * By default, every print statement outputs its arguments to a new line (see customization later)

## Choosing identifiers

* Naming identifiers sensibly makes code more readable and easily understandable
* Sensible identifiers are those describing the concepts their objects represent
* Multi-word identifiers can be used separated with underscores or inter-capitalization
* First character can only be a letter or the underscore
* Identifiers are case sensitive
* Avoid keywords or reserved words

## Objects and their references

* With an assignment statement, an object identifier is mapped to a memory address, AKA reference, where the value of the right-hand-side of the statement is stored
* A subsequent assignment is a different identifier-to-reference mapping i.e. a reference to a different memory location where the new value is stored
  * The memory location no longer mapped to the identifier is reclaimed by the garbage collector to be used for other objects (subsequent mappings)
* This is why a variable (object) can change types during the execution of a program

{% JDoodle %}
x = 10
print(type(x))
x = "hello"
print(type(x))
{% endJDoodle %}
