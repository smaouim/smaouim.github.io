abstract: Using a for loop to iterate over a string.

## Problem: Characters of a string


Write a program which :

* prompts the user for a string  of arbitrary length .
* prints each character of the string on a separate line, using a `while` loop.

Sample run:

```
Please type in some text: ab cd
a
b

c
d
```

{% empty_jdoodle %}

{% Solution %}
{% JDoodle %}
userEntry = input("Please type in some text: ")
i = 0
while i < len(userEntry):
    print(userEntry[i])
    i += 1
{% endJDoodle %}
{% endSolution %}

## Iterating over a string with "for"

Iterating through a string, more generally a sequence, is feasible `with` a while loop but is more elegant using the `for` construct.

```
for variable in iterable_sequence:
    <loop_body>
```

* At each iteration, the `variable` is assigned a value from the `iterable_sequence` in order (i.e. first iteration → first element, second iteration → second element, etc.)
* The `break` and `continue` constructs can be used in for loops, with the same semantics defined previously

{% JDoodle %}
inputString = input("Please type in some text: ")
for character in inputString:
    print(character)
{% endJDoodle %}

## Exercise: DNA strand

Write a program which:

* prompts the user for a string representing a DNA strand (validate input).
* prints the string representing the corresponding strand according to base pairing rules.

A string representing a DNA strand is a sequence of the characters "A", "T", "C" and "G". Base pairing rules bond "A" to "T" and "C" to "G".

> * Input validation and output computation can be done in the same loop.
> * Strings do not support individual element modification: they are "immutable"
> * Use an accumulator to generate the output string
{: .block-tip }

Sample run:

```
Enter a DNA strand: ACCTGACGT
The correspnding strand is: TGGACTGCA
```

{% empty_jdoodle %}

{% Solution %}
{% JDoodle %}
inStrand = input("Enter a DNA strand: ")
outStrand =""
for character in inStrand:
    if character == "A":
        outStrand += "T"
    elif character == "T":
        outStrand += "A"
    elif character == "C":
        outStrand += "G"
    elif character == "G":
        outStrand += "C"
    else:
        print("Not a valid DNA strand")
        break
if len(inStrand) == len(outStrand):
    print("The corresponding strand is:", outStrand)
{% endJDoodle %}
{% endSolution %}
